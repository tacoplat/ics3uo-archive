					<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
					<img class="image left" src="https://www.fastmetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cloud-computing-service-types-including-IoT-1024x706.png" alt="A diagram of the cloud, showing the connections between the services and the cloud." title="Cloud Diagram">
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3><u>Cloud computing</u> is the transmission of "computing services" over the internet. There are a multitude of services that can be offered as a part of cloud computing:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Office applications</li>
						<li>Professional tools</li>
						<li>Processing power</li>
						<li>Virtual Machine access</li>
						<li>Storage</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pgraph">Cloud computing usually operates as a renting or subscription-based service, where the customer pays a set amount every billing term in exchance for access to the desired service. For the most part, there are three main service models in cloud-based computing: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (Saas).</p>
					<div class="videowrap">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYGQcmZUTaw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
					</div>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS</h3><u>Infrastructure-as-a-Service</u> refers to the purchase of services required to develop things from scratch. Ex: servers and storage.<br><u>Platform-as-a-Service</u> models are similar to IaaS models, although they also include tools and utilities to aid in the development of applications and such. Ex: web hosting with database management.<br><u>Software-as-a-Service</u> provides users with whole applications to conduct their day-to-day business. Ex: photo-editing apps and word processors.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>The "Cloud" is beneficial to a variety of people. It allows customers to purchase services according to their needs; If a large corporation needs access to a server, they don't have to buy and maintain one by themselves. Conversely, for personal usage, cloud computing allows individuals to essentially "rent" licenses or access for program suites, like Adobe Creative Cloud or Microsoft Office 365, instead of shelling out large amounts for program packages or individual applications. In short, cloud-based services are flexible in nature.<br>One disadvantage to cloud services is the cost. Since cloud services are based on a rental plan, in the long term, one could end up paying much more than say, if they only needed lifetime access to one specific service.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Real-life Examples of Cloud Services</h3>The following are all actual examples of cloud computing in action, that you may use on a day-to-day basis: Microsoft Office 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive (and Google Suite), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Netflix.</p>

					<h2>Virtual and Augmented Reality</h2>
					<img class="image right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Augmented-reality.jpg" alt="A picture of an Augmented Reality App in action, inserting furniture into the real world." title="Augmented Reality App">
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>The Difference Between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h3>What is the difference between Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)? Well, to begin, virtual reality is an artificial simulation of an experience. This could refer to a simulation of a real-world event or atmosphere. When immersed in virtual reality, the user is made to feel like they are actually in the simulated environment, through the manipulation of at least one of the five senses. Virtual reality can be accesed through a wearable device, like a headset. Meanwhile, augmented reality is the enhancement of any existing scenario with the use of computer-aided overlays and enhancements. An example would be a mobile game with an additional layer of reality, like Pokemon GO and the AR camera filter.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Applications of VR and AR</h3>What can virtual and augmented reality be used for? Currently, these two technologies are being used for a multitude of purposes. From entertainment to occupation training, or even navigation, there is no doubt that VR and AR are trending. To elaborate, they can be used in video game experiences, media entertainment, in situations where danger is present, to test new colours for your home decor, insert furniture into your living room, test makeup, or even plan surgeries.</p>

					<h2>Big Data</h2>
					<img class="image left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Bar_graph_-_stock_price_statistics.jpg" alt="A bar chart, to represent data in general." title="Bar Graph">
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Big Data?</h3>Big Data refers to the massive amounts of data and information available in the world, in the form of data sets. It's useful to innovative corporations to indicate trends and allow for improvements for both the organization and individual consumer.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Why is it useful?</h3>From the vast amounts of data out there, we can search through it all and determine trends and patterns in several factors that have the potential to affect the success of something. We can investigate trends in regards to innovation, competition, and productivity growth. For example, a company can hire an analyst to pinpoint trends that they can manipulate to improve their products or services. Big Data can also be used to recommend services to customers, or even to aid in problem-solving.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>Sources of Big Data</h3>Big Data is a unthinkably large concept, which can be obtained from almost anywhere. Big Data comes from Facebook analytics, consumer surveys, experimental trials, log entries, call logs, you name it.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>How are companies applying Big Data?</h3>Apart from the examples mentioned above, Big Data has so many uses. The Oracle website suggests several: fraud detection through identifying patterns in service usage, machine learning, where machines use pre-existing knowledge and build on it, or even to increase operational efficiency.</p>
					<p class="pgraph"><h3>An Anecdote</h3>So, last year (the 2018-2019 school year), I was provided the opportunity to partake in the "Big Data Challenge", operated by the STEM Fellowship. Of course, the goal was to develop an innovative solution to a prevalent problem within our society, through the analysis of Big Data. That being said, I had absolutely no clue on what to do. I personally felt as if Big Data was like the ocean, and I was a sailor stranded within it. I'm sure with adequate training, one can make some <i>rad</i> contributions to society, but as of last year, it just wasn't right for me.</p>
