					<h2>What programs am <i><u>I</u></i> eligible for?</h2>
					<p class="pgraph">With the use of <a href="https://myblueprint.ca/">MyBlueprint</a>, I can determine a range of programs that I'm eligible for.<br><br>With my 18 earned credits, 12 planned credits, OSSLT completion and 80 volunteer hours as of November 2019, I can apply to the following programs by completion of grade 12: Computer Science at Queen's University, Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, Computer Science at UofT, BBA/CS Double-degree at Laurier and Waterloo, in addition to several engineering courses at various institutions. As I've previously mentioned, I want to get into the Mechatronics Engineering program at Waterloo, meaning I still have to earn credits in MCV4U, MHF4U (I have this next semester), SPH4U, SCH4U, ENG4U, and likely ICS4U/TDJ4M.</p>
